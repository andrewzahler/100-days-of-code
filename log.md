# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Dec. 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Signed up for #100DaysOfCode.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited and nervous. I definitely plan to take online courses during the 100 days, and given my schedule I may need to count that work as part of the challenge. Hope I don't get kicked out!

### Day 1: Dec. 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished day 1 of JavaScript30 (a Wes Bos course), building a JavaScript drum kit. 

**Thoughts**: I know I'm not supposed to count time spent on online courses as my hour of coding, but I've got limited time. And I haven't used JavaScript in a while so I need to freshen up my skills. Today's work covered familiar things and new-to-me syntax. For instance, I was reminded of how to use data attributes, but I learned for the first time about using the CSS selector "transition" and the event listener "transitionend." 

**Link to work**: I'm not going to push my own finish code for these JavaScript30 projects, but anyone interested can see Wes Bos's examples [here](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30/tree/master/01%20-%20JavaScript%20Drum%20Kit).
