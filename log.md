# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Dec. 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Signed up for #100DaysOfCode.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited and nervous. I definitely plan to take online courses during the 100 days, and given my schedule I may need to count that work as part of the challenge. Hope I don't get kicked out!

### Day 1: Dec. 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished Day 1 of JavaScript30 (a Wes Bos course), building a JavaScript drum kit. 

**Thoughts**: I know I'm not supposed to count time spent on online courses as my hour of coding, but I've got limited time. And I haven't used JavaScript in a while so I need to freshen up my skills. Today's work covered familiar things and new-to-me syntax. For instance, I was reminded of how to use data attributes, but I learned for the first time about using the CSS attribute "transition" and the event listener "transitionend." 

**Link to work**: I'm not going to push my own finish code for these JavaScript30 projects, but anyone interested can see Wes Bos's examples [here](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30/tree/master/01%20-%20JavaScript%20Drum%20Kit).  

### Day 2: Dec. 30, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Today I wrapped up the second exercise in JavaScript30, which involves building a JavaScript clock.

**Thoughts**: It was another day of review plus new learning. Reviewed material included the querySelector method (also reviewed on Day 1) and working with Date() and setting time intervals. New to me was using the CSS "transform" and "transition-timing-function" attributes. It's funny that the focus of these exercises is on JavaScript, but a lot of what I'm learning is about CSS. At the same time, of course, I'm refreshing my knowledge of vanilla JavaScript and its syntax, methods and interaction with the DOM. (Side note: Because the focus is on vanilla JS, the course uses, as Wes Bos writes, "No Frameworks, No Compilers, No Libraries, No Boilerplate.")  

**Link to Work**: Here's [Wes Bos's code for this exercise](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30/tree/master/02%20-%20JS%20and%20CSS%20Clock). I promise to start sharing my own as soon as I start to work on stuff that's more original.
