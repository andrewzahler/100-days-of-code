# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Dec. 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Signed up for #100DaysOfCode.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited and nervous. I definitely plan to take online courses during the 100 days, and given my schedule I may need to count that work as part of the challenge. Hope I don't get kicked out!
